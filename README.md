# Math Notes

This is a repository for my personal math notes, written in LaTeX. The notes are organized into several files:
- **notes.tex**: This file contains older chapters of my notes. I keep them separate to reduce compilation times.
- **main.tex**: This is the main file where I write my notes.
- **partielleIntegration.tex**: This is a separate project where I wrote some notes on integration by parts. It's not part of the main notes, but I've included it here for completeness.
- **test.tex**: This is a file that I use to try stuff like new commands or packages.

I use this repository to version control my notes and to make them easily accessible from anywhere. If you find any errors or have any suggestions, feel free to let me know!

## Topics and Language

The notes cover topics in mathematics that are taught in an advanced high school math course in Germany, specifically in the state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg.
They are taught in preparation for the Abitur exam, which is the standardized test that high school students take in Germany.

Please note that the notes are written in German and may not be practical for English speakers.

So far the notes feature the following topics:
1. Differential Calculus
2. Exponential Functions
3. Integral Calculus
4. Functions and their Graphs
5. Systems of Linear Equations
6. Lines and Planes

## Compiling the Notes

To compile the notes, you'll need a LaTeX distribution installed on your system. I personally use [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) on Windows, but there are other options available.

To compile the notes, simply run `latexmk main.tex`. This will automatically handle all the necessary compilations and generate a PDF output.
